Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a water-soluble vitamin essential for carbohydrate metabolism and neuronal function. It serves as a coenzyme in energy production pathways, including pyruvate dehydrogenase and the Krebs cycle, supporting ATP generation and nervous system activity.

The RDA for adults is 1.2 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women. Body stores are limited, making regular intake necessary.

Deficiency results in impaired energy metabolism and neurological dysfunction. Early symptoms include fatigue, irritability, and reduced appetite. Severe deficiency leads to beriberi, presenting as cardiovascular or neurological disease. Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome may occur in individuals with chronic alcohol use.

Food sources include whole grains, legumes, pork, nuts, seeds, and fortified cereals. Refining grains significantly reduces thiamine content.

Supplement forms include thiamine hydrochloride and benfotiamine. Typical supplemental doses range from 10–100 mg daily depending on clinical need.

Alcohol consumption impairs thiamine absorption and utilization. Certain diuretics may increase urinary loss. Individuals receiving prolonged intravenous glucose without adequate thiamine are at risk of deficiency.

Older adults, individuals with alcohol dependence, and those with malnutrition or chronic illness represent higher-risk populations. Vegans generally obtain adequate intake when consuming whole grains and legumes.
