Selenium is an essential trace mineral incorporated into selenoproteins that function in antioxidant defense, thyroid hormone metabolism, and immune regulation. It is required for glutathione peroxidase activity, which protects cells from oxidative stress.

The RDA for adults is 55 µg/day. Selenium status varies geographically depending on soil content and food sources.

Deficiency may lead to impaired immune function, thyroid dysfunction, muscle weakness, and cardiomyopathy in severe cases. Mild deficiency may contribute to fatigue and reduced antioxidant capacity.

Dietary sources include Brazil nuts, seafood, organ meats, eggs, and whole grains. Brazil nuts contain highly variable but often high selenium concentrations.

Supplement forms include selenomethionine and sodium selenite. Typical supplementation ranges from 50–200 µg daily. Intake above the upper limit of 400 µg/day may result in selenosis, characterized by hair loss, nail brittleness, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

Selenium may interact with thyroid medications by influencing hormone metabolism. Excess supplementation combined with high dietary intake increases toxicity risk.

Older adults and individuals with restricted diets may benefit from monitoring intake. Balanced intake is essential due to the narrow therapeutic window.
