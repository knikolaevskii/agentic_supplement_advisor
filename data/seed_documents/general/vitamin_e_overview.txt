Vitamin E refers to a group of fat-soluble compounds known as tocopherols and tocotrienols, with alpha-tocopherol being the biologically active form in humans. It functions primarily as a lipid-phase antioxidant protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage and supporting immune and neurological function.

The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for adults is 15 mg of alpha-tocopherol daily. Vitamin E deficiency is rare but may occur in individuals with fat-malabsorption disorders or genetic conditions affecting lipid transport.

Deficiency symptoms include peripheral neuropathy, muscle weakness, impaired coordination, and hemolytic anemia due to increased oxidative damage to red blood cells.

Major food sources include nuts, seeds, vegetable oils (sunflower, safflower), wheat germ, spinach, and avocados. Dietary intake typically provides sufficient amounts when diets include plant fats.

Supplement forms include natural d-alpha-tocopherol and synthetic dl-alpha-tocopherol. Supplemental doses typically range from 15–200 mg daily. High doses exceeding 400 IU/day have been associated with increased bleeding risk.

Vitamin E may potentiate the effects of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications, increasing bleeding risk. Careful monitoring is advised when combined with warfarin or aspirin therapy.

Older adults and individuals with malabsorption syndromes may require supplementation. Very high intake is not recommended due to potential adverse effects. Balanced dietary intake remains the preferred source.
