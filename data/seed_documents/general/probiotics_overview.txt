Probiotics Overview

Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts. They support gut health, digestion, and immune function. Common strains include Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species.

Probiotics may help with antibiotic-associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and certain allergies. CFU counts typically range from 1 billion to 100 billion per serving. Refrigerated products may have better viability for certain strains. Effects are strain-specific, so choose products with clinical evidence for your specific health goal.

Saccharomyces boulardii is a beneficial yeast probiotic particularly useful for preventing traveler's diarrhea and C. difficile infection. Prebiotics (dietary fibers that feed beneficial bacteria) work synergistically with probiotics; good prebiotic sources include garlic, onions, bananas, and asparagus.

Fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, and kombucha are natural sources of probiotics, though the specific strains and concentrations vary. People with compromised immune systems should consult a healthcare provider before starting probiotic supplementation, as there is a small risk of infection in immunocompromised individuals.
