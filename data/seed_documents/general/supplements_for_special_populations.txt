Nutritional requirements vary across populations due to dietary patterns, physiological changes, and increased metabolic demands. Certain groups may benefit from targeted supplementation when dietary intake alone is insufficient.

Vegetarians and vegans are at increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency because reliable sources of B12 are primarily animal-derived foods. Vitamin B12 is essential for neurological function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation. Supplementation or consumption of fortified foods is generally recommended. Additional nutrients of concern include iron, zinc, iodine, calcium, omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA), and vitamin D. Plant-based iron has lower bioavailability, and strategies such as combining iron-rich foods with vitamin C can enhance absorption.

During pregnancy, nutrient demands increase to support fetal development and maternal health. Prenatal supplementation commonly includes folic acid, iron, iodine, vitamin D, and DHA. Folic acid intake before conception and during early pregnancy reduces risk of neural tube defects. Iron requirements rise due to expanded maternal blood volume. Excessive vitamin A intake in retinol form should be avoided because of teratogenic risk. Supplementation decisions should be guided by healthcare professionals and laboratory assessment when available.

Older adults experience physiological changes affecting nutrient absorption and metabolism. Reduced gastric acid production can impair vitamin B12 release from food proteins, making deficiency more common even with adequate dietary intake. Calcium and vitamin D requirements increase due to declining bone density and reduced skin synthesis of vitamin D. Magnesium intake may also become insufficient due to dietary changes or medication use. Attention to protein intake and overall nutritional adequacy is important to prevent sarcopenia.

Athletes and physically active individuals may have elevated nutrient requirements related to energy expenditure, muscle repair, and electrolyte losses through sweat. Iron deficiency is relatively common among endurance athletes, particularly females. Adequate intake of protein, magnesium, and electrolytes such as sodium and potassium supports recovery and neuromuscular function. Vitamin D status may influence muscle performance and immune resilience, especially in indoor athletes with limited sun exposure.

Supplementation should not replace balanced nutrition but may address identifiable gaps or increased physiological needs. Over-supplementation can pose risks, particularly with fat-soluble vitamins and minerals that accumulate in the body. Individual assessment—including diet evaluation, lifestyle factors, and laboratory testing when appropriate—remains the preferred approach.

In summary, vegans, pregnant individuals, older adults, and athletes represent populations with distinct nutritional considerations. Evidence-based supplementation tailored to physiological demands can support health outcomes when guided by clinical evaluation and established nutritional recommendations.
