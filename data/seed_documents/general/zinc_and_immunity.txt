Zinc and Immunity

Zinc is a trace mineral essential for immune function, wound healing, and protein synthesis. The RDA is 11 mg for men and 8 mg for women. Zinc lozenges taken within 24 hours of cold onset may shorten cold duration.

Oysters are the richest food source, followed by red meat, poultry, beans, and nuts. Supplementation above 40 mg per day can cause copper deficiency over time. Zinc picolinate and zinc citrate are well-absorbed forms. Vegetarians may need up to 50% more zinc due to lower bioavailability from plant sources.

Zinc plays a critical role in immune cell development and communication. It also functions as an antioxidant, helping protect cells from damage. Zinc deficiency impairs both innate and adaptive immune responses, increasing susceptibility to infections.

Common symptoms of zinc deficiency include impaired taste and smell, poor wound healing, hair loss, and skin lesions. Long-term use of zinc supplements should be paired with copper supplementation (typically 1-2 mg of copper per 15 mg of zinc) to prevent copper depletion. Intranasal zinc products should be avoided, as they have been linked to permanent loss of smell.
