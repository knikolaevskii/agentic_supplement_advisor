Calcium and Bone Health

Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body and is critical for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth. The RDA is 1000 mg for most adults, increasing to 1200 mg for women over 50 and men over 70. Approximately 99% of the body's calcium is stored in bones and teeth.

Dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese) are the richest dietary sources. Non-dairy sources include fortified plant milks, tofu made with calcium sulfate, kale, broccoli, and canned sardines with bones. Calcium absorption decreases with age and is influenced by vitamin D status.

Common supplement forms include calcium carbonate (best absorbed with food, highest elemental calcium) and calcium citrate (absorbed with or without food, better for individuals with low stomach acid). Taking calcium in doses of 500 mg or less at a time improves absorption.

Excessive calcium supplementation (above 2500 mg daily) may increase the risk of kidney stones and cardiovascular events. Calcium and vitamin D work together for bone health; vitamin K2 is also important as it directs calcium into bones rather than soft tissues. Weight-bearing exercise complements calcium intake for optimal bone density. Postmenopausal women are at particular risk for osteoporosis and should discuss supplementation strategies with their healthcare provider.
