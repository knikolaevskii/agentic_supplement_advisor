Choline is an essential nutrient involved in cell membrane structure, neurotransmitter synthesis (acetylcholine), lipid transport, and liver function. It is critical for brain development and methylation pathways.

The adequate intake (AI) is 550 mg/day for men and 425 mg/day for women.

Deficiency may result in fatty liver, muscle damage, and impaired cognitive function. Suboptimal intake is common due to limited dietary awareness.

Food sources include eggs, liver, poultry, fish, soybeans, and cruciferous vegetables. Egg yolks are among the richest dietary sources.

Supplement forms include choline bitartrate, phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), and alpha-GPC. Typical supplemental doses range from 250–500 mg daily.

High intake may cause gastrointestinal discomfort or fishy body odor due to trimethylamine production. Choline metabolism interacts with liver function and gut microbiota activity.

Pregnant individuals have increased requirements due to fetal brain development. Vegans may have lower intake because many rich sources are animal-derived.
