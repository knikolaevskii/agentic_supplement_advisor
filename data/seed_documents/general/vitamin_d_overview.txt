Vitamin D Overview

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for calcium absorption and bone health. The recommended daily allowance is 600-800 IU for most adults, though many experts suggest 1000-2000 IU, especially in northern latitudes. Deficiency is common and linked to weakened bones, fatigue, and impaired immune function.

The best natural source is sunlight exposure; dietary sources include fatty fish, fortified milk, and egg yolks. Supplementation with D3 (cholecalciferol) is generally preferred over D2. Blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D above 30 ng/mL are considered sufficient.

Vitamin D also plays a role in immune regulation, mood stability, and muscle function. Some research links low vitamin D levels to increased risk of respiratory infections, depression, and autoimmune conditions. People with darker skin, those who spend limited time outdoors, and older adults are at higher risk of deficiency.

When supplementing, taking vitamin D with a fat-containing meal improves absorption. Toxicity is rare but possible at very high doses (above 10,000 IU daily for extended periods), potentially causing hypercalcemia. Regular blood testing is recommended for those on high-dose supplementation.
