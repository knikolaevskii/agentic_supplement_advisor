Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) are essential fats with anti-inflammatory properties. They support cardiovascular health, brain function, and joint mobility. The American Heart Association recommends eating fatty fish at least twice per week.

For supplementation, 1000-2000 mg of combined EPA/DHA daily is a common dose. Fish oil, krill oil, and algae-based supplements are popular sources. Algae-based omega-3 is suitable for vegetarians and vegans. Quality matters: look for third-party tested products to avoid contaminants like mercury and PCBs.

EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) is primarily associated with anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular benefits, while DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is particularly important for brain health and cognitive function. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are advised to ensure adequate DHA intake for fetal brain development.

ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) is a plant-based omega-3 found in flaxseed, chia seeds, and walnuts, but conversion to EPA and DHA in the body is very low (typically under 10%). For this reason, direct EPA/DHA supplementation is generally preferred. Fish oil supplements should be stored in the refrigerator to prevent oxidation and rancidity.
