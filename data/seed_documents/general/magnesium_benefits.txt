Magnesium Benefits

Magnesium is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions including muscle and nerve function, blood sugar control, and blood pressure regulation. The RDA is 400-420 mg for men and 310-320 mg for women. Many adults do not meet the recommended intake through diet alone.

Good food sources include nuts, seeds, whole grains, and dark leafy greens. Common supplement forms include magnesium citrate (good bioavailability), magnesium glycinate (gentle on stomach, promotes relaxation), and magnesium oxide (lower absorption but higher elemental magnesium content).

Deficiency symptoms include muscle cramps, insomnia, anxiety, and irregular heartbeat. Chronic magnesium deficiency may contribute to osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Alcohol consumption, certain medications (like proton pump inhibitors), and gastrointestinal conditions can increase the risk of deficiency.

Magnesium threonate is a newer form that may cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively, making it of interest for cognitive support. Topical magnesium (Epsom salt baths, magnesium oil) is popular but evidence for transdermal absorption is limited. The tolerable upper limit for supplemental magnesium is 350 mg per day; excess can cause diarrhea, which is the primary side effect.
