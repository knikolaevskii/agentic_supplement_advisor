Iodine is an essential mineral required for synthesis of thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which regulate metabolic rate, growth, and neurological development.

The RDA for adults is 150 µg/day, increasing to 220 µg/day during pregnancy and 290 µg/day during lactation.

Deficiency leads to reduced thyroid hormone production, resulting in goiter, hypothyroidism, fatigue, weight gain, and impaired cognitive development during pregnancy.

Primary dietary sources include iodized salt, seafood, dairy products, and seaweed. Intake varies significantly based on dietary habits and regional fortification practices.

Supplement forms include potassium iodide and kelp-derived iodine. Typical supplementation ranges from 150 µg daily when dietary intake is insufficient.

Excess iodine intake may also disrupt thyroid function, particularly in individuals with autoimmune thyroid disease. Both deficiency and excess can cause thyroid dysfunction.

Pregnant individuals have increased requirements due to fetal neurological development. Vegans and individuals avoiding iodized salt may have increased deficiency risk.
