Vitamin B6 refers to pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, which function as coenzymes in amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, hemoglobin formation, and homocysteine regulation.

The RDA for adults aged 19–50 years is 1.3 mg/day, increasing to 1.7 mg/day for older men and 1.5 mg/day for older women.

Deficiency symptoms include dermatitis, microcytic anemia, depression, confusion, and peripheral neuropathy. Deficiency may arise from poor nutrition, chronic kidney disease, or certain medications.

Food sources include poultry, fish, bananas, potatoes, chickpeas, fortified cereals, and whole grains.

Supplement forms typically contain pyridoxine hydrochloride. Common supplemental doses range from 10–50 mg daily. Chronic intake above 100 mg/day may cause sensory neuropathy.

Vitamin B6 interacts with medications such as isoniazid and oral contraceptives, which may increase requirements. High doses may reduce effectiveness of levodopa when administered without carbidopa.

Pregnant individuals may require adequate intake due to increased metabolic demand. Older adults may experience reduced dietary intake and absorption efficiency.
