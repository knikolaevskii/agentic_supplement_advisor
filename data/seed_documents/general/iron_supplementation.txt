Iron Supplementation

Iron is an essential mineral needed for hemoglobin production and oxygen transport. The RDA is 8 mg for men and 18 mg for premenopausal women. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide and leads to anemia, fatigue, and impaired cognitive function.

Heme iron from animal sources (red meat, liver) is better absorbed than non-heme iron from plants (spinach, legumes). Vitamin C enhances non-heme iron absorption when consumed together. Common supplement forms include ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, and iron bisglycinate.

Side effects of iron supplementation may include constipation, nausea, and dark stools. Iron bisglycinate (chelated iron) tends to cause fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Taking iron on an empty stomach improves absorption, but taking it with food can reduce stomach upset.

Excessive iron intake can be dangerous, especially in individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis. Serum ferritin is the most useful marker for iron stores; levels below 30 ng/mL suggest depletion, while levels above 200 ng/mL in men or 150 ng/mL in women may indicate overload. Iron supplements should be kept away from children, as accidental overdose can be life-threatening.
