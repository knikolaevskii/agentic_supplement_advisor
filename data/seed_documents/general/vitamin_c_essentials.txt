Vitamin C Essentials

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble antioxidant that supports immune function, collagen synthesis, and iron absorption. The RDA is 75 mg for women and 90 mg for men, with smokers needing an additional 35 mg. The upper limit is 2000 mg per day.

High-dose supplementation has not been proven to prevent colds but may reduce their duration by about 8% in adults. Food sources include citrus fruits, strawberries, bell peppers, and broccoli. Excess intake may cause gastrointestinal discomfort and diarrhea.

Vitamin C is also important for wound healing, maintaining cartilage, and protecting cells from oxidative damage. It helps regenerate other antioxidants in the body, including vitamin E. Unlike most animals, humans cannot synthesize vitamin C and must obtain it from diet or supplements.

Common supplement forms include ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate (buffered, gentler on the stomach), and liposomal vitamin C (claimed to have better absorption). Taking vitamin C in divided doses throughout the day may improve utilization compared to a single large dose.
