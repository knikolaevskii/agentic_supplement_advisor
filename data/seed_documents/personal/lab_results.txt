PHYSICIAN NOTES
---------------
Patient presents with fatigue, occasional muscle cramps, and difficulty
concentrating. Dietary history indicates limited red meat intake and
minimal sun exposure due to indoor work schedule.

Key findings:
- Significant Vitamin D deficiency (14 ng/mL) - likely contributing to fatigue
- Vitamin B12 below normal range - may explain concentration difficulties
- Low ferritin with mildly low hemoglobin and low MCV - suggestive of
  early iron-deficiency anemia
- Zinc marginally below reference range
- Borderline lipid panel - monitor and consider dietary modifications
- Magnesium and Vitamin C at lower end of normal - may benefit from
  supplementation given symptoms

Recommendations:
- Recheck levels in 3 months after initiating supplementation
- Consider referral to nutritionist for dietary optimization
- Follow up on iron status with additional iron studies if symptoms persist
